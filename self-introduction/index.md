Hi! My name is Anastasiya Tomasheva. I finished Mogilev State University name of Arkady Kuleshov. I was a journalist, then i worked in call center, 
and now i`m mailing tester. My friend tryed to involve me in programming in the times of my student`s life. She worked in EPAM like QA Engeneer, 
and i prepared to the interview to the same scope. I didn`t pass then, but when i first time created page with some words - it was amazing! I think 
it`s wonderful - you take some symbols, numbers or letters, and buttons, pages and even games appear on the screen! And all this can (and have to) move, 
have some interactive. And under the hood it`s just zeroes and ones! For me it was some kind of magic. I understand, that all this explanable, but i think 
this is really cool! And i want to be a person, who can create this magic. That`s why i choosing coding. Additionally, for instanse, i wiil tell you about 
my daily life. About two years my life - it`s almost only learning. In the last year i also had second job. I love videogames, but for this years i played 
only five times, i guess... I`m learning before work, after work, on the weekends. I`m learning coding or learning english. And despite this i`m still here 
and still didn`t out of my mind. At least, i almost sure about this. So, i think that means, that i really like this field.

About pet projects... Almost all my works - on GitHub. Generally them - result of learning tasks. But for soul i`m creating and decorating pages, that contains 
some quotes with exciting thoughts, that i would to share with others.
